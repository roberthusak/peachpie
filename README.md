## What is Peachpie?
Peachpie is a modern PHP compiler based on Roslyn by Microsoft and drawing from our popular Phalanger project. It allows PHP to be executed within the .NET framework, thereby opening the door for PHP developers into the world of .NET – and vice versa.

## Project goals
-**Increased performance**: Peachpie's extensive type analysis and the influence of Microsoft Roslyn should provide an improved performance of PHP applications and components. 

-**Cross-platform development**: the project compiles legacy PHP code into portable class libraries, enabling developers to build cross-platform apps and libraries for Microsoft platforms.  

-**Full .NET compatibility**: in the future, Peachpie will be fully compatible with the PHP language.  

-**Both-way interoperability**: the project allows for hybrid applications, where parts are written in C# and others in PHP. The parts will be entirely compatible and can communicate seamlessly, all within the .NET framework.  


## How to build or execute?
This project is a work in progress. Please be aware that Peachpie is not complete and is therefore not intended to run full applications, but you are welcome to use it for your inspiration. You can run Peachpie in Visual Studio Code or on the command line. Please refer to our [short introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVWVInYiYLY) to see how to run the compiler on the command line and to our [Getting Started](https://github.com/iolevel/peachpie/wiki/Getting-Started) section. The video below shows how Peachpie can be integrated into Visual Studio Code:
